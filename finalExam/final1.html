            <h2>What this site covers</h2>
            <p>
                Kathak is a North Indian classical dance form known for musical intelligence, swift footwork,
                controlled spins, and storytelling that can move from subtle to dramatic in a single phrase.
                This website brings the form into a student-friendly framework without flattening it into
                a short definition. You will see the history, the structure of rhythm, the role of gharanas,
                the connection to music, and the way modern dancers balance tradition with new themes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aesthetic is inspired by North India and Himalayan landscapes, deep indigo evenings,
                cedar forests, and saffron-toned sunrise light. The visuals are original graphics created
                for this assignment.

                    <p>
                        Kathak is often taught with a deep respect for the grammar of time. The dancer is not
                        “decorating” a beat, the dancer is embodying it. <em>Tatkar</em> builds accuracy that
                        later supports speed, complexity, and improvisational confidence.

                    <p>
                        <em>Abhinaya</em> brings narrative life to technique. A gaze shift, a controlled pause,
                        or a single hand gesture can imply an entire world. Students usually learn that expression
                        requires discipline, not just emotion.

                    <p>
                        Gharanas are often described as style lineages. At the student level, the most helpful
                        approach is to understand them as emphasis traditions. They guide training priorities
                        while still sharing foundational grammar.

            <h2>Why this matters for students</h2>
            <p>
                Learning Kathak can strengthen musical listening, memory for sequences, stamina, and confidence.
                It also gives students an entry point into how culture, history, and art influence each other.
                Even short practice sessions can build a habit of deliberate focus that transfers to academics.
