            <h2>History, with a student-first lens</h2>
            <p>
                Any short history of Kathak is a simplification. Still, students benefit from a structured
                overview that explains how the form carries both narrative roots and sophisticated rhythmic
                evolution. Kathak is widely introduced in classrooms as a tradition shaped by storytelling,
                later refined in courtly and urban performance environments, and eventually expanded through
                modern institutions and global stages.

            <h2 id="rhythm-vocab">Rhythm architecture and vocabulary</h2>
            <p>
                Rhythm in Kathak is not just a background feature. It is a language. Students often learn
                rhythm concepts alongside spoken syllables that map sound to movement.
            </p>
            <ol class="standard">
                <li><strong>Taal</strong> - the rhythmic cycle that organizes time</li>
                <li><strong>Theka</strong> - the core pattern that anchors a taal</li>
                <li><strong>Bol</strong> - syllables connecting sound to movement and memory</li>
                <li><strong>Lehra</strong> - a melodic line that supports practice</li>
                <li><strong>Tihai</strong> - a repeated cadence resolving to the sam</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <h2>Abhinaya, the narrative heart</h2>
            <p>
                Expression asks the dancer to be a storyteller without speaking. It can depict devotion,
                humor, longing, courage, tenderness, or quiet contemplation. For students, abhinaya training
                often begins with clarity, not intensity. The first goal is to make meaning readable.
            </p>
            <ul class="standard">
                <li>Align facial expression with rhythm and phrasing</li>
                <li>Use gaze shifts to structure narrative attention</li>
                <li>Keep hand and arm movement purposeful</li>
                <li>Practice short story segments with musical cues</li>
                <li>Build emotional range without exaggeration</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 id="gharanas">Gharanas in brief</h2>
            <p>
                The gharana idea is complex in advanced study. At a classroom level, we can describe
                gharanas as lineages that shape emphasis. Students should learn this vocabulary without
                feeling pressured to reduce their training identity to a label.
            </p>
            <ul class="standard">
                <li><strong>Lucknow</strong> - commonly associated with refined abhinaya and elegance</li>
                <li><strong>Jaipur</strong> - often linked with powerful footwork and rhythmic clarity</li>
                <li><strong>Banaras</strong> - known for distinct compositional flavors in many teachings</li>
                <li><strong>Modern pedagogy</strong> - cross-gharanna learning is increasingly common</li>
                <li><strong>Student takeaway</strong> - master foundations first, style comes with time</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Costume, music, and stage culture</h2>
            <p>
                Costume and stage choices help communicate the setting of a piece. Traditional silhouettes,
                jewelry, and ghungroo are part of the visual and sonic identity of the form. Music is typically
                anchored by percussion patterns and melodic support that guide timing and emotional tone.
            </p>
            <ul class="standard">
                <li>Ghungroo as both sound instrument and training tool</li>
                <li>Costume choices that align with theme and venue</li>
                <li>Tabla and other percussion as rhythmic partners</li>
                <li>Lehra or melodic lines that support practice structure</li>
                <li>Stage discipline that signals respect for lineage</li>
